# Plant-disease-detection-model
This project presents an AI-powered plant disease detection system that uses image processing techniques and deep learning to identify and classify diseases from leaf images. The goal is to help farmers detect diseases early, ensure timely intervention, and improve crop health monitoring.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Manual inspection of plant health is time-consuming and subjective. This system provides an automated, accurate, and scalable solution to identify diseases in plant leaves using a combination of:

OpenCV-based image preprocessing

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification

A PyQt5 GUI for user-friendly interaction

ðŸŒ± Key Features
Multi-class disease classification

Custom image processing pipeline (thresholding, edge detection, etc.)

PyQt5 GUI for image input and real-time prediction

High accuracy on trained dataset (e.g., 96.93% on Jatropha)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Type: Leaf images of healthy and diseased plants (e.g., Jatropha, tomato, etc.)

Format: JPEG/PNG images with corresponding class labels

Preprocessing: Resizing, augmentation, normalization

Split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test

ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras

PyQt5

Matplotlib & NumPy
